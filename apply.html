        This exciting opportunity is available for faculty and postdoctoral researchers from Cornell University and Ithaca College.

        We are seeking faculty members who will actively contribute to our vibrant, self-governing community. In a formal capacity, Fellows are expected to organize two events per semester, including at least one talk. 
        More informally, Fellows are encouraged to participate in meals, invite guests, and engage with the diverse community of residents, which includes other Faculty Fellows, undergraduate, and graduate students from various disciplines. 
        Fellows have also found success in hosting formal and informal reading groups within the House.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we generally favor applicants without dependents, we consider applications from those who intend to live with partners or children on a case-by-case basis.

      <h2>Top Ten Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <ol class="faq-list">
        <li><strong>Do I need to translate all of my certificates?</strong><br>
          No, there is no need for translation to English. But an explanation of the grading system would be appreciated.
        </li>

        <li><strong>How strongly is GPA considered in the application process?</strong><br>
          There is no GPA requirement for the application. However, once admitted House members must maintain a 3.0 minimum GPA per terms of scholarship.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Can second year undergraduates apply?</strong><br>
          Students who will be 3rd year undergraduates in the upcoming school year are encouraged to apply. 
          We can only accept applications from undergraduates who will be incoming 3rd or 4th year undergraduates.
        </li>

        <li><strong>How long should my essay be? Is it okay if it is a little above/below the limit?</strong><br>
          Each essay should be in conformity with the stated word limit. Nonetheless, if it is slightly above or below the word limit, this is okay. You should conclude your final thoughts.
        </li>

        <li><strong>What is the application acceptance rate/how selective is the application?</strong><br>
          We do not give out this information, as we would rather just encourage all those interested to apply.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Is there a parking lot? Could I park at the House?</strong><br>
          Yes to both questions!
        </li>

        <li><strong>How inclusive is the House?</strong><br>
          Our house is proud of its diversity and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disabilities.
        </li>

        <li><strong>How are dietary restrictions accommodated?</strong><br>
          Our House is very accommodating of allergic needs and dietary restrictions. We can offer vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options.
        </li>

        <li><strong>How should I prepare for my interview in case I am selected?</strong><br>
          Your interview will be based on the material you submitted in your application package. 
          In most cases, you will be interviewed by three current House members. 
          Please, review your application and essays carefully. 
          We do not intend interviews to be stressful experiences; rather, we want to get to know you better!
